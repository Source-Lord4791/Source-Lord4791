- 👋 Hi, throughout my life, I've been asked "who are you?" and "where are you from?"
- 👀 I’m the byproduct of the 2 nations
- 🌱 I’m the son of the first generation immigrant
- 💞️ I’m the son of an seamstress
-    I'm a brotherr to 2 college graduates sisters
-    I'm also a survivor
-    A surivor of the physical and mental abuse
-    A survivor who learned that forgiveness is more important than hatred and that the struggles defines who I am as a person
-    I grew up from a traditional Asian household where the father would beat the son and the son would tell himself everyday "Thank god its me and not my sisters"
-    I'm from a household where I refuse to let anger mark my childhood and found the escape through the love of food and technology
-    So, who am I?
-    I'm a foodie and technie
-    I'm a lover of pizza, pasta, burger and mac&cheese
-    I'm the dot com boom and bust generation (where one's wealth is only limited by his/her imagination)
-    Most of all, I'm an American; but also with Chinese blood (and am damn proud to be both)
